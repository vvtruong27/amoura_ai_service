[grammar:on]  i'll break from the lists now. i'm pretty easygoing. i'm a believer in letting people live their lives without adding to their own mile-high plates of shit. after all, we live in the same, little world.  i like people. yeah, that's a broad phrase. i like to think about the way people think, to put it in a roundabout way, i suppose. it's interesting the way we act, interact, and go about life.  i also happen to like sex. let's get our giggles out. i will, however, be safe and say prudes need not apply. i'm also an active kinkster. turn off? buh bye. :]  still with me? good.  oh right! i'm a bit of a fucking geek. i also like to exercise my right to expletives. fuck. (okay, maybe that was uncalled for. maybe.) i'm (very) occasionally known to replace my entire vocabulary with four letter words, sometimes for minutes on end. this usually follows a heated, and often hilarious rant. i didn't realize how much i actually swore 'till someone pointed it out to me. the most appropriate response at the time i could come up with was, ""well, fuck, dude."" that said, i'm capable of keeping a clean mouth at least 8 hours out of the day, and around children. no holds barred after 9pm, though.  my profile currently indicates that i'm 'straight', but if labels are required, i'd fit the title of 'heteroflexible' a bit closer. okay, maybe 'hetero(very)flexible'. i'll warn ya straight up as well-- i'm not a manly man oozing testosterone, and i damn well plan to keep it that way. if you're looking for an 'all-american image of man' i'm not your guy. oh, and for the love of mike, don't try to change me. if i feel the need or urge to change, it'll happen. just remember, i'm not your toy, mmkay? mmkay.  so, what am i looking for? before you get into all this stuff, i'm mainly looking to increase my friend base. i need more people to chill and game with. i don't care what you're playing. i might even play d&d 4th, if i have to. if i -have- to. it'd also be cool to meet more nightlifey people. i spent three years working and going to school, instead of exploring like i should have been. :x i need nighttime escapes! know of any good bars or shows? tell me! drag me! force me! quietly suggest! anything! (especially if they need workers :p) if you know about any raves going on in the bay area (bonus points if you can supply a ride? :p) poke at me.  well, if you made it this far, by all means, keep going. odds are, i'll probably like ya. anyways, as you can see from my sidebar, i'm looking for new friends, long-term and short-term dating, activity partners, long distance pen pals, and sex partners. (i do hate the term casual encounters. sounds like we're going for coffee and a donut. we can, though. speaking of which, i know a sweet place in the mission to get a shit ton of free donuts. more about that later.)  new friends: yes, i'm looking for new friends. i'm a very open and personal kind of guy, and i like my friends to feel close. i don't believe in having emotionless friendship, and i like to be emotionally connected to my friends on some level. this does not mean that i want committed relationships from my friends or anything of the sort. i simply believe that if friends can't trust each other with their emotions, they could just as well be strangers passing each other on the street. emotional connections are what i believe separate friends from acquaintances. friends empower each other-- they build each other up. occasionally, friends have issues. it happens. they get over it. needless to say, i don't like sugar-coating life. oh, and don't watch what ya say, tmi's lost it's authority around me. i don't have much of a personal bubble, either. i'm just warning you long in advance. i do respect your bubble, though. :)  long term dating: how long is 'long term' per se? weeks? months? years? honestly, if i'm still 'dating' someone after six months and we haven't moved to either a friend or relationship status, well, that's probably the end of the ""long term dating"". i'm not the master of romance, but i am a romantic. i am on a dating site after all. if you're looking to date purely for sex, i'd highly advise you look on my 'sex partner' sections. ;) if you think you've got an interest, please send a message :). also, please, please, please, (really, please.) don't confuse my asking to hang out as asking you on a date. also, don't assume that because we hang out that we are dating. i also tend to lean rather heavily toward polyamory.  short term dating: this is pretty much the same thing as the above, so i'm not going to bother writing another block of 'stuff'.  activity partners: i'm down to meet up and try anything, rock climbing, biking, swimming, drawing, whatever. just give me fair warning, eh? if you've got a moped i'd love to blast with you.  long distance pen pals: so what if you live a few states away? i love talking to people who generally want to befriend me. that said, if we're going to talk, please be literate. this goes for anyone i talk to. while i might say things like, ""y hello thar,"" or ,""teh fheck's you doin'?"", that doesn't mean i don't like full, literate conversations. as you can see from reading this profile, (shit, you are still reading, aren't you?) i like to be well spoken, and i can't stand too much of, ""hey, wuts good? im chillin @ home wer r u?"" no offense to people to who text talk, but i just can't stand to read it too long. a little bit's okay, i just don't want to have to decipher what the fuck you're trying to say.  sex partners: before you make assumptions, just because i am also seeking sex partners does not mean i am only seeking sex partners. now, i said i hate the term 'casual encounters' but that doesn't mean i like 'sex partners' either. i like to bundle this term loosely with 'friends' because if i just plain don't like someone i'm having sex with and that doesn't change, i'm probably not going to have sex with that person much longer. i prefer that my partners are at least friends. now for my ever-present, ""this does not in any way, shape, form, or definition mean that we are dating or in a committed relationship."" friends can have sex. in my opinion, there's nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure with a friend. and... the 'nitty gritty'. i am completely std free, and i am tested regularly. obviously, you should be too. condoms are a must. i definitely believe in 'safe and sane' play, and i'd really prefer anyone who is seeking sex be capable of having open communication about it. ya know, stuff like what works, what doesn't, boundaries, etc. while i like to say i'm experienced (i certainly think i am, and i've had no complaints), there is a lot that i haven't tried, so creativity is a big plus. i'm willing to try almost anything. in case you can't tell, i'm not a boy scout.  remember that part about tmi having lost authority?  as a general note, any time you're uncomfortable or have something on your mind that you want to tell me, let me know. i'd rather you risk my feelings be hurt than disappear over something that could just be resolved in an adult fashion.  ***  other things i'm interested in  geminis: as you can see, i'm a gemini and very serious about it. what's this mean? well, if you've ever read a personality profile for a gemini, it's correct. both the good and the bad. now, geminis, what does this mean for you? i'm wary of you. oh, am i wary of you. no offense, but i know myself. (yeah, i know you're giggling right now because you're thinking of yourself and going, ""oooooooh.. teehee"" i'm onto your ass.) at the same time, i love you and embrace you with more open arms than possibly anyone else. if it's a friendship you're after, you got it, if it's a date, sure, if it's a relationship, i'm a little cautious, but you know exactly why, and if it's sex, it's probably gonna happen at the drop of a hat.  dragons (chinese zodiac): because of your likely brazen, bold, and firm nature, as well as my brazen, bold, and firm nature it's a likelihood that we will argue and compete a lot. that's not a bad thing though. it's good to be able to defend a stance against someone you're already friends with. strangers may not exchange the time of day, but friends can argue for hours and still be happy.  ***  a few other things  so, this section was an afterthought. here's a few random things.  -stephen colbert is a man-like demigod. (among men)  -i'd be a capoeirista if i stopped being so damned lazy.  -i'd be a tracuer if i started running again.  -i really want a purp bong.  -i'd make my own clothes if i still had a sewing machine and all the supplies i needed.  -i'm easier to understand with a fake, generic british or irish accent. either is 10x better with a cigarette in my mouth.  -my hometown is monrovia, california. i don't plan on going back for more than a weekend at a time.  -i feel like my profile seems extra serious. :x  so, you're still reading. i am impressed. if i've noticed you're reading my profile, i'm probably doing the same to yours by now.  i am charismatic, spontaneous, and possibly a superhero",20.87992170804206,105.83179500633476,Việt Nam,Hà Nội,Hà Đông,dog,cooking & food - movies & tv,vietnamese,23

wish i could go and fetch you a nice glass of wine or a cocktail while you browselike a gallery opening, or a harry potter partywouldn't that be civilized? yes. then you could meander about at your leisure, sipping your drink as you took in all these ridiculously insane oversized canvasses of me rendered in pseudo third world dictator fashion with curious titles such as whoops! and wow! and the very popular boom-shacka-lacka-boom! i am all about the mishpooka. there's nothing hotter than a woman in the shivering, stiffening, toe-curling throes of la petite mortcrying out at the top of her lungs ohhhh b*a*b*y!  about me:  white male. charming, goofy writer-boy (prose, poetry, erotica, humor, published songwriter for two platinum bay area bands, a novelist and screenwriter and occasional blogger), highly unconventional in a most subversive way. just wrote a screenplay/erotic thriller that takes place in paris. more stats: 5'8 171 lbs., broad shoulders, bats left, throws right. all my own hair (s&p) on top, baked ziti, excellent trivia partner. though i rarely drink, free-thinking and cuirious, i will take you to quirky, out-of-the-way dive bars, introduce you to new cocktails and be your designated driver, and even let you wear my coat if you get cold. dogs (i love labs) absolutely love me. so do infants and little kids i don't know why, maybe cause i've had so many alreadyvery divorced, very available. i brush my teeth. a lot. my glass is always half full. if you need routine teleconferencing with a beau, i'm probably not for you (though i do give good email). i'm unconventional, never unethical, and i can sometimes be wrong, but i am never in doubt, but would you believe...humble.  here are a few of my favorite things (in no particular order & feel free to skim if you like):  wonderwall, baseball games, my garden, anywhere in italy, cooking, laughing, making love in the morning with the window open so we can hear the birds chirping, reading voraciously, writing like nobody's business, the king's speech, italian food, tennessee williams, david lindley and his cool compadre tommy fitzgerro, coco chanel-coco chanel...she was so good i had to say it twice, seinfeld, the sunrise, the most wonderful robert speisman, tantric massage, holding hands, more kissing, more laughing, figs, intelligent & inspiring women, shania's in your eyes, brazenhead, joe capp, lucisweet anne in carroll gardens, the pierre and the carlsyle, james taylor, etta james, balthazar in soho, women in hats, cafe' habana on elizabeth and linda, e-man, my three kids and my first who didn't make it but still exists where it counts, gibson's in chicago, kissing...the new black, hints, fearless tears, peter lugar's steakhouse in brooklyn, blue water, nipples, my books, chrissie hynde and the pretenders, hanalei bay, the always elegant robert plant, pbs, dean & deluca, elaine's, laird, 38th and madison, the late great duva, cartell, the lovely lena from london, wendell berry's 'a place n earth', sardinia, buenos aires, moleskine ruled notepads, npr, caveass, billy dusheki, friday harbor, ketel one gimlets straight up--on other special occasions, my songs, la guria bakery, delfina's pizzeria on 18th st., johnny boy at the piano, the angel from park high school in baltimore, the old neal, high thread count white shirts, being bombarded with kisses when i wake up, laudee, curb your enthusiasm, the tooth ferry, david sedaris, purple & green, jennifer garner's lips, the stirring strains of bagpipes, philip roth, myself, mojitos...on other special occasions, adventure, costa rica, pilot p-700 pens (0.7 black)a must always, my books, the slanted door, kitty's place, liquid, blistex, thomas pynchon, left leaning always, aqua teen hunger force, magic hat #9, chicken parm subs & conti's pizza in princeton, my blackberry cobbler, lucian freud, baby, mmb's kisses and her massive brain, random acts of kindness, extra texture, dostoevsky, parker posey, faith, king cuisine & gualala on new year's, beethoven's 5th, the light of being, molly, tk, a fresh cup of coffee in the morning with a splash of cream, more laughter, jeff spicoli, spirit, integrity, brunettes and dirty blondes, the soul of a woman, unconventional wisdom, my father's tears which i never saw, all things godzilla and the always irrepressible charles dickens.  and there are a few things that i don't like:  insincerity, posers, and shallow people.  and then there's you:  i dunno. gads. a fun, mature, cool gal, funny & smart. well read, adores kissing, dimples, sense of humor a must, the more twisted the better. sexy. girlish. sophisticated but down-to-earth. attractive (sure, why not?). slender with curves. outgoing. naughty. yeah, naughty. in fact, a bit of a freak, but brilliant & charismatic, patient, pensive, soulful, and attentive. someone who can hold my attention sexually and intellectually. someone actively involved in the arts would be nice, as i am, and consequently a tad eccentric & bohemian. someone who is passionate and understands what it means to have a passion. someone with good underwear. someone who will probably want to wear my white shirts. someone who is au' natural, and knows that kissing is the new black. someone who will drop everything and head to quepos, costa rica with me. someone who knows when i'm kidding and when i'm serious (it happens occasionally, really, it does). someone who likes to play dress up and looks irresistible all dolled up as a catholic school girl gone bad or a preppy, pigtailed cheerleader. someone who can introduce/teach me how to play the piano and teach me new things (i can promise you a very attentive, appreciative, and reciprocal student). someone who'll leap into my arms and scream my name when asked who's your daddy?  you are/do/don't: sensual, happy, adjusted emotionally and intellectually, very pretty, blessed with a nice body, lustful, tactile, love to laugh--yes, without it we're all fucked, refreshingly kinky, know how to flip the bird gracefully when needed, being touched, held, a reader, a thinker, sincere, bold, confident, sometimes naughty, you are a kissing fool--i said that at least twice now--hmm, love your family and your friends, well traveled, educated, can speak more than one language, stylish, charismatic, can engage in inspiring conversation, don't have jock itch, like the rain, reading the sunday times all day in bed, can swim, have had an abundance of experiences, won and lost at love, love dogs and childrenhmmm, that's about it. i don't mind taking it a little slow and trying out the friends first thing. i'm tired of going on dates that seem like a waste of time and would like to find someone i click with so i don't have to sit there in some bar and get drunk (very rarely) and try to entertain strange new women several nights a week. make me happy and i'll do the same for you. i'm not perfect (far from it), but hopefully you're a lot closer to it than myself. and i do need is to find you attractiveyes it's subjective and superficial, i know, but there you goall my info is right here in this post. i don't ask anymore of you than i'm providing. i like slender women with nice bodies. i've got a nice physique and i'd ask that you do as well, but i do not seek perfection, unless you're my doctor, and if you are, there will be no excuses. i don't think that's too much to ask, but you'd be surprised. height is not an issue with me. i like tall women and i don't care if you wear ten inch heels if that's what you like. short women are great too. it's all good. oh, and please be nice, and humble with a bit of a wild side.  so if you'd like to respond, please do. don't feel you need to impress me with a long intricate emailunless you'd like to, in which case, please do, by all meansbut please tell me a little about yourselfexperience has taught me, if i'm not your type, no amount of time and effort in crafting a

(i also have a fun time trying to define my values, and put words to the ineffable. i struggle with the fact that i don't see myself as unreasonable or invulnerable to logic; i just believe there is more to my life experience than -just- logic, or -just- the ineffable. :) )  my ber-frank paragraph upfront: i want to birth and raise at least one kid. i am embarking on how to accomplish this with my current friend network, planning things out, establishing committees, and stuff. i would live to find a co-conspirator for this kind of project, but at least want a partner or partners that like kids and the women that have them. :p (now, back to regular profile infoes!)  my real self likes to smell good smells, from all sorts of things. i love the smell of freshly-laundered clothes, especially on myself or on others. i like the smell of clean hair, and skin, and murphy's oil soap. i aim to use non-petrochemical laundry detergents, that tend to smell faintly like lavender, or some other herb. but somehow, the smell of standard detergent-cleaned clothes is appealing, as well: the strong chemical smell of clean, wafting off a person i'm snuggling with...nothing beats this! (even lysol has its charms!)  i'm rather sensory based: i like the feel of things, the taste and texture of them, as well as the thrill of delicious smells. i love worn wood floors, and wooden handles, and the homes of retired hippies, with papasan round chairs, and bamboo. i sometimes see sound as color; i get very emotional when faced with striking, sweeping music or dance. sean dorsey, mark morris: i love modern dance, and art. olafur eliasson makes me grin...  i like eating delicious, particular foods from a foodie friend's kitchen. i love the feel and smell of hand lotions, and essential oils.  folk dance is a big part of my life -- contra dance and scottish country especially -- and i am drawn very much to folk music, especially fiddles.  i like indie comic books, singalong music and all sorts of crafts. i love the arts and most dance forms. i am queer, bi, polyamorous, even if i mostly date one person at a time, feminist and a quiet pagan. i'm a health education advocate, too.  i claim as friends and soul-siblings the radical faeries community from short mountain sanctuary in tennessee. i learned how to crochet and knit from queer boys at this rural commune. i relearned knitting about 4 years ago, from a nice swedish lady on bart.  i'm an unabashed morning person. love the taste of caffe latte, but don't have a caffeine habit. i like kukicha and earl grey, on rare caffeinated moments.  soy de miami, viviendo en oakland, california para como 7 aos ahora. me gusta mucho el espaol de mxico/california...puedo entenderlo ms facil!  pues, usualmente estoy usando espaol solamente en trabajo, pero es un parte de m identidad....para ser una mujer, una gringa de miami, aprendiendo culturas diferentes y disfrutando las personas quines yo encuentro.  je parle un peu de francais, d'une voyage  france l'hiver 2006....paris, bretagne, et la cathedral de chartres, avec le labyrinth trs magnifique et trs vieux. enfin, les cits de strausbourg et luxembourg. j'aime les ""puddings"" de danon, mais non les ""keyboards"" de la eu. :p  j'ai les settings pour les accents! trs bien. j'ai des amis franaise quebeois. maintenant, j'apprends quelque chose canadienne franaise...poutine, le slang de quebec, et les ftes. :p avec chance, je vais aprendre franais plus vite, plus vite, plus vite...  i am grinning, heartfelt, and watching out.",20.9538898553826,105.92173351834812,Việt Nam,Hà Nội,Hoàng Mai,dog - fish,gaming,vietnamese,37
